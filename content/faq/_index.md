        *Event Logistics Questions*

        **In what language will the hackathon be held in?**
        The event will be fully held in English.

        **Will accommodation in Amsterdam be facilitated?**  
        Unfortunately, we are unable to facilitate accommodation in any form. Participants are expected to plan their own form of stay in Amsterdam or its surroundings.

        **Is food provided?**  
        Yes, we will provide breakfast, lunch, and snacks in-between.

        *Hackathon Questions*

        **What are the deliverables at the end of the hackathon?**  
        Teams are expected to present their findings and crafted policies to the audience in a short, 4-minute pitch and a policy action paper. This round focuses on the policy and its content itself, such as what has to be done to solve an issue.

        **How will the winners be selected?**  
        After each team has presented their findings, the judges will select finalists in each team. These finalists are then asked to present in a 3-minute pitch their plan to get policy buy-in. In other words, finalist teams should show how they would convince, e.g., politicians and other stakeholders to support their policy so that it gets adopted. After this, the judges may then ask questions about the finalistsâ€™ whole policy paper and about both presentations. Lastly, the judges will discuss before selecting a winner for each policy theme.
