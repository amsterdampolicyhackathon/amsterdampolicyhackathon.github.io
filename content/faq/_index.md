        #### Who can attend the event?
        We welcome anyone with a strong interest in interdisciplinary policymaking. At our event, we also emphasize the role of data and technology to enhance policymaking. However, technical skills (e.g., programming) are not strictly required. While we generally target university students and young professionals, anyone can register as participant. We welcome students from different disciplinary backgrounds. 

        #### What is a "policy hackathon"?
        A policy hackathon may sound unfamiliar for some at first, but the event essentially takes on the format of a traditional hackathon, but with a broader and socially-oriented focus on creating policy rather than technical applications or code solutions. Thus, while we welcome designs or demos of technical solutions that could enhance policymaking, they are not mandatory and the emphasis of the event is on crafting innovative and impactful policy proposals. 
        
        ## Event Logistics Questions

        #### In what language will the hackathon be held in?
        The event will be fully held in English.

        #### Will accommodation in Amsterdam be facilitated?
        We are unable to facilitate accommodation in any form. Participants are expected to plan their own
        stay.

        ## Hackathon Questions

        #### What are the deliverables at the end of the hackathon? 
        Teams are expected to present their findings and crafted policies to the audience in a short, 3-minute pitch and a policy action paper. This round focuses on the policy and its content itself, such as what has to be done to solve an issue.

        #### How will the winners be selected?
        After each team has presented their findings, the jury will select finalists in each team. These finalists are then asked to present in a 3-minute pitch their plan to get policy buy-in. In other words, finalist teams should show how they would convince, e.g., politicians and other stakeholders to support their policy so that it gets adopted. After this, the jury may then ask questions about the finalistsâ€™ policy proposal and the presentations. Lastly, the jury will convene and select a winner for each policy theme.

<!-- #### Where can my team and I work during the weekends?
        We are currently reaching out to locations of the University of Amsterdam and the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam to reserve collaboration spaces and desks. However, you are free to hack anywhere you want, like at a cozy cafe or a park. Live attendance is mandatory for the plenary sessions, like during the kick-off and final pitches. Attendance to workshops or guidance sessions for questions is optional.  -->
